# ST-Home-Notify-v2

## Summary
Home Notify is a SmartApp for SmartThings that performs various types of notifications when certain things happen at home. This app can be installed multiple times to allow for different profiles based on your current mode. The purpose of this app is to replace some of the functionality of Smart Home Monitor though I can be used along with it. Home Notify allows you to select contact and motion sensors to trigger your notifications. You can also select a single Mode or multiple Modes so that this only executes when in a specific mode. If you want Home Notify to do things differently based on Mode, just install another instance of the SmartApp. You can choose to be notified in a variety of ways: Alarms, Music Players, Speech Synthesizers & Push Notifications [any combination of them]. Set off a siren or play a track on an alarm, play a track on a music player, and / or have speech synthesizer announce the event description (think: Front door has opened).

Again: If you have several scenarios you would like to control, just install the app from "My Apps" multiple times.
